# form_switch
a complicated script to manage two touchscreens where one is convertible

Please build three binaries from this source changing the switch variable for each condition.
Feel free to change the direction variable set for each switch condition, mine is set
to a rather unconventional portrait for the monitor (right), and I have also not implemented the
inverted direction, but the binary whatever that xinput takes to scale the touch area is there for it.

what you do with those binaries is for you to discover, but I have them bound to two keys, and an icon.
